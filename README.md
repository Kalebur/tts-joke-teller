# Text-to-Speech Joke Teller
A project that polls an API to get a random joke, then reads that joke aloud using text-to-speech.

## Features
* Simple but responsive layout
* Polls two different APIs
   * First API selects and returns a random joke (all programming related in this project)
   * Second API receives the joke returned from the first API and converts it to audio
